This project replicates the visual design of Spotify’s homepage, emphasizing layout accuracy, design consistency, and clean styling.
No JavaScript or APIs are used — the focus is purely on the frontend interface and hover-based interactivity.

This static web project recreates the Spotify homepage layout featuring navigation, playlists, trending sections, and a functional-looking media control bar.
The design aims to demonstrate frontend development skills and attention to UI detail using only HTML and CSS.
